# Chat App Project

The given project is a direct messaging chat app using:
- React
- Socket.io for message exchange 

## Demo

Here you find a minimalistic demo - style it to your own needs :)

https://rob-chat.vercel.app/

Once you opened the page, right click on the browser tab and "duplicate" the tab to simulate a chat.

Then login on each tab with a different user. And start chatting.

## Prep

Prepare an .env file and put a key 
"REACT_APP_MESSAGE_SERVER_URL" inside.

E.g. you can use my message server for testing:

`REACT_APP_MESSAGE_SERVER_URL=https://rob-chat-api.herokuapp.com`

Or you setup your own message server - see my sample project here:
